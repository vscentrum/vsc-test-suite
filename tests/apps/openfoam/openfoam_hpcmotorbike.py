'''
OpenFOAM is free, open source software for CFD from the OpenFOAM Foundation.
The benchmark considered here is a variant of the Motorbike example shipped
with OpenFOAM, adapted to better suit typical usage of OpenFOAM in an HPC
environment. The input files are talken from the Large variant of the HPC
motorbike benchmark
(see https://develop.openfoam.com/committees/hpc/-/wikis/HPC-motorbike).

Before the actual CFD solver starts, the mesh has to be constructed. In
production runs, the mesh generation typically will only take small fraction
of the total wall time, and is therefore not part of the performance timings
in this test. The mesh generation has a large contribution to the runtime of
this test. So unfortunately, only a small portion is used to get performance
metrics.

The test currently runs using all available cores on a node as this is likely
how it would be used in production runs. Cases are generated for 1 and 4 full
nodes in order to study the internode scaling. Comparing timings for different
clusters is difficult because of the different core counts and the different
versions of OpenFOAM that are used.
As said before, directly comparing timings on different cluster is not easy.
Looking at the timings on 1 node, it seems that the Intel-based nodes of
genius (36 cores per node) and hydra-skylake (40 cores per node) offer a
better performance *per core* than the AMD-based nodes of vaughan (64 cores
per node) and Hortense (128 cores per node). Of course, the decision to do the
comparison on a *per core* basis is very debatable. These numbers then
probably just illustrate that on genius/hydra you get a higher-memory bandwidth
*per core*, which is of course beneficial for this memory-bound code.
On most clusters a superlinear speedup is observed when comparing the timings
on 1 full node and 4 full nodes. This has been reported before for OpenFOAM
and is most likely caused by the increase in availability and use of cache
memory when using more nodes, which again is very beneficial for a memory-bound
code like OpenFOAM. It is not yet clear why this is not the case on genius.
